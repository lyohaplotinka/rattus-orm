title: Breaking compatibility again (version 0.4.0)

It hasn’t been long since the release of 0.3.0, and here we 
are with another minor release – version 0.4.0. Yes, backward 
compatibility is broken again, but I believe the reason is a 
good one. 

<!-- truncate -->

I have significantly reworked how attributes like 
types and relations are used in the Rattus ORM code. While 
last release's changes were related to the names of decorators 
and methods, this time I focused on what is probably the most 
important thing for frontend developers - the size of the bundle.

## What Has Been Done

I noticed that even if you just create a database and add a model 
with no keys, some types and even relations would still be 
included in your bundle. This is a legacy of Vuex ORM Next. 

This happened because for some model field operations, we need to 
know precisely what we are dealing with: type, relation, and 
sometimes even the specific type or relation. In Vuex ORM Next, 
this was done using `instanceof` checks, which require the code 
of the specific class. In version 0.4.0, `@rattus-orm/core` 
has been revised to avoid this.

However, that’s not all. If you’re not using decorators to describe 
models, you know that each type or relation is a static method 
of the `Model` class:
```typescript title="In v0.3.0"
export class User extends Model {
    static entity = 'user'
    static fields () {
        return {
            id: this.uidField(),
            name: this.stringField(''),
            age: this.numberField(0)
        }
    }
}
```

This means that the most basic class **always** includes all types 
and relations! 

In version 0.4.0, this has also been revised. Now to describe a field, 
you need to call a separate function instead of a static method:
```typescript title="In v0.4.0"
export class User extends Model {
    static entity = 'user'
  
    static fields () {
        return {
          id: createUidField(this),
          name: createStringField(this, ''),
          age: createNumberField(this, 0)
        }
    }
}
```

The downside here is minor: we need to pass the class constructor context 
to the function. This is always the first argument in all methods, and 
the rest follow the same order as before. 

The same applies to relations – they are now separate functions with 
the constructor context as the first argument. 

This change means we only include what is actually used by your 
application in the bundle.

## Results

Let’s look at the results. For building the file in this experiment, 
I use [Bun v1.1.30](https://bun.sh/).

### Model Without Fields

First, let’s see what we have with the following source file:
```typescript title="size-test.ts"
import { Model } from '@rattus-orm/core'
class User extends Model {}
```

**Let’s build it using version 0.3.0:**
```shell title="v0.3.0"
$ bun build size-test.ts --minify --outfile size-test-built.js > /dev/null  \
$ && npx tiny-file-size --gzip --brotli ./size-test-built.js

size-test-built.js 19.87 KB │ gzip: 5.17 KB │ brotli: 4.61 KB
```

We see that the file size is **19.87 KB** uncompressed and 
**4.61 KB** compressed with Brotli.

**What does it look like with version 0.4.0:**
```shell title="v0.4.0"
$ bun build size-test.ts --minify --outfile size-test-built.js > /dev/null  \
$ && npx tiny-file-size --gzip --brotli ./size-test-built.js

size-test-built.js 12.34 KB │ gzip: 3.77 KB │ brotli: 3.37 KB
```

The file size is reduced by **37.8%** uncompressed and 
about **27%** compressed. Looks good!

### Model with a Single StringField

Now let’s add a `name` property to our model – it will be a string.
```typescript title="size-test.ts"
import { Model } from '@rattus-orm/core'

// v0.3.0
import { StringField } from '@rattus-orm/core/decorators'
// v0.4.0
import { StringField } from '@rattus-orm/core/field-types'

class User extends Model {
  @StringField('')
  public name: string
}
```

**Build with 0.3.0:**
```shell title="v0.3.0"
$ bun build size-test.ts --minify --outfile size-test-built.js > /dev/null  \
$ && npx tiny-file-size --gzip --brotli ./size-test-built.js

size-test-built.js 20.38 KB │ gzip: 5.41 KB │ brotli: 4.82 KB
```

**And with 0.4.0:**
```shell title="v0.4.0"
$ bun build size-test.ts --minify --outfile size-test-built.js > /dev/null  \
$ && npx tiny-file-size --gzip --brotli ./size-test-built.js

size-test-built.js 13.51 KB │ gzip: 4.21 KB │ brotli: 3.77 KB
```

The file is about **33%** smaller uncompressed and **22%** 
smaller compressed.

In conclusion, the bundle size is reduced by roughly a third. 
Naturally, if you use all data types and relations, the bundle 
size will be the same as in version 0.3.0. However, the goal 
of this release is to benefit those who use only specific 
parts of Rattus ORM.
