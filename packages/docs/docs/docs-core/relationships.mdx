# Relationships

All relationships between models fully replicate the relationships from
`@vuex-orm/core@next`. To understand how
relationships are organized, we recommend familiarizing yourself with
the Vuex ORM Next documentation on relationships.

[Read the Documentation](https://next.vuex-orm.org/guide/relationships/getting-started.html)

:::info
Remember that Rattus ORM is more oriented towards usage
with TypeScript. For documentation on relationship decorators,
you can refer to [this section](https://next.vuex-orm.org/guide/model/decorators.html).
