# Model

### Basics

:::info
This part of the documentation is written following `vuex-orm-next`.
However, Rattus ORM is more oriented towards working with
TypeScript and decorators.
:::

Models are definitions of data schemas that will be
processed by Rattus ORM. You can define any number
of models as per your needs.

To define a model, create a class that inherits
from the `Model` class:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value={'ts'} label={'TypeScript'}>
        ```typescript title="src/data/User.ts"
        import { Model } from '@rattus-orm/core'
        import { StringField, UidField, NumberField } from '@rattus-orm/core/decorators'

        export class User extends Model {
            public static entity = 'user'

            @UidField()
            public id: string

            @StringField('')
            public name: string

            @NumberField(0)
            public age: number
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value={'js'} label={'JavaScript'}>
        ```javascript title="src/data/User.js"
        import { Model } from '@rattus-orm/core'

        export class User extends Model {
            static entity = 'user'

            static fields () {
                return {
                    id: this.uidField(),
                    name: this.stringField(''),
                    age: this.numberField(0)
                }
            }
        }
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The static property `entity` is the name of the "table" in
our database. All modules in the store will be created
automatically by the database and data provider.

### TypeScript and Vite troubleshooting
If you are using Vite with TypeScript, make sure you have these settings in `tsconfig.json`:
```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true
  }
}
```

You may also encounter the problem of missing data in your models. In this case it is worth using
the following syntax:
```typescript
class User extends Model {
  public static entity = 'users'

  @StringField('')
  // public id: string - will not work,
  // all fields of your models will be "null"
  declare id: string
```
If you are getting error from ESBuild in dev mode, like `[ERROR] Decorators are not valid here`, make sure esbuild is targeted to your tsconfig in `vite.config.mts`:

```typescript title="vite.config.mts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: {
    esbuildOptions: {
      tsconfig: 'tsconfig.json',
    },
  },
});
```

### Field Types

#### General Type

Use the decorator `@AttrField(value)` (or the method `this.attrField()`) to define the most
general field. The argument is the default value of the field,
which will be used when creating new data if the field is missing.

```typescript
export class User extends Model {
    public static entity = 'user'

    @AttrField(null)
    public anyField: any
}
```

#### Primitive Types
You can use primitive type attributes:
`@StringField('')`, `@NumberField(0)`, or `@BooleanField(false)`
(for JS - `this.stringField()`, `this.numberField()`, and `this.booleanField()`).
These attributes ensure casting by default, which
converts the given value to the specified type.
For example, `'0'` is converted to `0`, and `1` to `true`.
As with `this.attrField()`, the argument is the
default value.

```typescript
export class User extends Model {
    public static entity = 'user'

    @StringField('')
    public name: string

    @NumberField(0)
    public age: number

    @BooleanField(true)
    public isAwesome: boolean
}
```

:::warning
Rattus ORM will not **validate** the values that
go into the fields. Instead, **type casting** will be performed.
The string `John Doe` going into a Boolean field will be
converted to `true`.
:::

You can disable type casting for a specific model. To do this, you
need to declare a public static property `dataTypeCasting` and set
its value to `false`. In such a case, even if a field is marked
with the `@BooleanField` decorator, and a one (1) is entered into the model,
it will not be converted to `true`, but will remain a one (1).
There will also be no validation. If you need to validate values,
consider looking at [Zod Validate plugin](/docs/plugins/docs-plugin-zod-validate/getting-started).

```typescript
export class User extends Model {
    public static entity = 'user'
    // type casting of fields is disabled
    public static dataTypeCasting = false

    @StringField('')
    public name: string

    @NumberField(0)
    public age: number

    @BooleanField(true)
    public isAwesome: boolean
}
```

#### UID Type
`@UidField()`  (or `this.uidField()` in JS) generates a unique
identifier if the value for this field is missing.

```typescript
export class User extends Model {
    public static entity = 'user'

    @UidField()
    public id: string
}
```
By default, a UUID v4 will be created. If you need a different
algorithm, you can pass a callback that will generate
the ID:

```typescript
export class User extends Model {
    public static entity = 'user'

    @UidField(() => myIdGenerator())
    public id: string
}
```

#### Date type
Starting from version **0.3.0**, the Date type is available. It converts
an incoming string or number into an instance of the Date class.
If the date turns out to be invalid, a value with the zero date (`new Date(0)`)
will be set. By default, the type does not accept null, but
it can be made nullable using a setting.

```typescript
export class User extends Model {
    public static entity = 'user'

    @DateField(null, { nullable: true })
    public createdAt: Date
}
```

### Primary Key
Rattus ORM assumes that every entity has a
primary key `id`. If it's different, you can
indicate which key to pay attention to:
```typescript
export class User extends Model {
    public static entity = 'user'
    public static primaryKey = 'myId'

    // You can also specify an array
    public static primaryKey = ['myId', 'otherId']

    @UidField(() => myIdGenerator())
    public myId: string
}
```

If the given data does not have the key, Rattus ORM
will generate it automatically when inserting data.
